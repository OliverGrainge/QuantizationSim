## QuantizationSim 

This reporsitoy provides a fast way to simulate the quantization 
of neural networks with arbitrary bits and configurations. Currently
there are limited number of precisions and dataypes supported by hardware 
for real quantization. Therefore it is not possible to see the effect of 
quantization with arbitrary bit-width. This library provides the functionality 
to see the performance of a network quantized under arbitrary per-layer bit-width 
configuration
